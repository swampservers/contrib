# how tos

## Shop Weapons:

Add the weapon to lua/weapons/ as normal (See API for coding stuff)

Register the weapon in lua/sps/items/free.lua or lua/sps/items/weapons.lua as shown

Add the weapon to lua/sps/categories.lua

## One time use models:

Upload the playermodel

Register in lua/sps/items/uniquemodels.lua

Add to lua/sps/categories.lua

## Props ("wearables"):

Upload model, add to wearables.lua, add to categories.lua

Add the uploaded files to commonfiles.txt because wearables are usable across servers

# api

see lua/autorun/player_extension.lua:

player:IsPony()

player:IsAFK()

player:GetRank() (0 for players 1+ for staff)

entity:ExtEmitSound(soundname, options): its basically like EmitSound but does stuff so that if one guy is in a theater he won't hear it if its played outside the theater. It also handles the "lip syncing" (not really syncing - they move randomly) for speech sounds. options is a keyvalue table (or nil), possible arguments are:
- pitch
- crouchpitch
- level
- volume
- channel
- ent: emit from this ent instead of player
- shared: emit on client without networking, assuming called in shared function
- speech: move player lips (time to move lips, or auto if < 0)

player:GetLocation(): returns a integer for what location they are at
player:GetLocationName(): gets the location name (look at the cinema gamemode for more on this, the swamp version is similar)

global function: Safe(player or entity): is the player/entity in a safe/protected area or otherwise safe
