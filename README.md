This repository previously contained a public mirror of certain *clientside* code and assets from Swamp Cinema. Its purpose was to crowdsource tweaks and fixes.

As it is possible to view clientside content in GMod using plugins such as gluasteal, this repository did not grant any new access to Swamp Cinema content.

The readme contained the following notice: **This repository and most of its content is copyrighted and owned by Swamp Servers LLC. All other content is, to the best of our knowledge, used under license. If your copyrighted work appears here without permission, please contact the email shown here. This repository DOES NOT license its contents to be used for other purposes, nor does its existence on GitHub imply such a license.**

Regardless, due to plagiarism, we have decided to take this content down from GitHub.

If you have a bug to report, please do so on our Discord.

If you have made contributions in the past and would like access to the new private mirror of this content, contact us.
