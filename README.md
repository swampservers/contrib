# swampservers/contrib

Please read the **COPYRIGHT** notice of the bottom of this page. If you contribute to this repository, then you agree to the **CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT** also at the bottom of this page.

# Overview

Contribute to Swamp Cinema here! How to:

- 'Fork' this repo. This creates a copy of it you have edit permissions of.
- Clone your forked repo into garrysmod/addons (so it creates garrysmod/addons/contrib), edit it, and push it back. You'll need the GitHub desktop or commandline client. Look up GitHub tutorials for that.
- For clientside work, check out the [devtools](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/dev/cl_devtools.lua) which allow you to work on the actual server environment.
- Make a pull request on this repo. Use the 'compare across forks' link to request to merge your changes on your forked repo to this repo. Accepted changes are installed automatically, although new files won't run until after a server reset.
- Minor, single-file changes can just be done in the web browser by clicking the pencil icon.

All models/materials/sounds in this repository will be automatically uploaded to our workshop addons, so don't worry about that.

# Code

- Please submit code that is **clean and concise**. You may want to run it through [glualint](https://fptje.github.io/glualint-web/). Do a good job! 
- Make your code compatible with our [loading system](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/autorun/swamp.lua).
- Try to put cinema-specific code in gamemodes/cinema/ and generic (cross-server) code in lua/. Both folders are loaded using our loading system.

\
*file: [lua/swamp/extensions/cl_me.lua](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/extensions/cl_me.lua)*

\
*file: [lua/swamp/extensions/cl_vgui_function.lua](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/extensions/cl_vgui_function.lua)*

### function vgui(classname, parent (optional), constructor)
This defines the function vgui(classname, parent (optional), constructor) which creates and returns a panel.\
\
 The parent should only be passed when creating a root element (eg. a DFrame) which need a parent.\
 Child elements should be constructed using vgui() from within the parent's constructor, and their parent will be set automatically.\
\
 This is helpful for creating complex guis as the hierarchy of the layout is clearly reflected in the code structure.\
\
 Example: (a better example is in the file)\
 ```\
 vgui("Panel", function(p)\
    -- p is the panel, set it up here\
    vgui("DLabel", function(p)\
        -- p is the label here\
    end)\
 end)\
 ```
\
*file: [lua/swamp/extensions/cl_vgui_function.lua](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/extensions/cl_vgui_function.lua)*

\
*file: [lua/swamp/extensions/sh_ent_timer.lua](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/extensions/sh_ent_timer.lua)*

### function Entity:TimerSimple(delay, callback)
A timer which will only call the callback (with the entity passed as the argument) if the ent is still valid
\
*file: [lua/swamp/extensions/sh_ent_timer.lua](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/extensions/sh_ent_timer.lua)*

### Ents  (global variable)
A global cache of all entities, in subtables divided by classname.\
 Works on client and server. Much, much faster than `ents.FindByClass` or even `player.GetAll`\
 Each subtable is ordered and will never be nil even if no entities were created.\
 To use it try something like this: `for i,v in ipairs(Ents.prop_physics) do` ...
\
*file: [lua/swamp/extensions/sh_ents_cache.lua](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/extensions/sh_ents_cache.lua)*

### ply.NWP = {}

\
*file: [lua/swamp/extensions/sh_player_extension.lua](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/extensions/sh_player_extension.lua)*

### function Player:UsingWeapon(class)
Faster than writing `IsValid(ply:GetActiveWeapon()) and ply:GetActiveWeapon():GetClass()==class`
\
*file: [lua/swamp/extensions/sh_player_extension.lua](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/extensions/sh_player_extension.lua)*

### function FindSinglePlayer(name, exact_overrides_multiple)
Find a player whose name contains some text. If it finds exactly one matching player, returns that player. Otherwise, returns the number of found players (0 or >=2). To use this check isnumber() on the return.
\
*file: [lua/swamp/extensions/sh_playerbyname.lua](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/extensions/sh_playerbyname.lua)*

### function string.FormatSeconds(sec)

\
*file: [lua/swamp/misc/sh_player_name_filter.lua](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/misc/sh_player_name_filter.lua)*

### function player.GetBySteamID(id)
Unlike the built-in function, this (along with player.GetBySteamID64 and player.GetByAccountID) is fast.
\
*file: [lua/swamp/misc/sh_playerbysteamid.lua](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/misc/sh_playerbysteamid.lua)*

### function Player:GetTitle()
Get current title string or ""
\
*file: [lua/swamp/misc/sh_titles.lua](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/misc/sh_titles.lua)*

### function Player:RateLimit(name, interval, burst)
Rate limiter for net recievers and commands and whatnot. Interval is how many seconds between each action. Burst is how many we can do fast (default 1).\
 The function returns TRUE if the action should be blocked, FALSE if it should be ALLOWED. So do like `if ply:RateLimit("thing", 1, 1) then return end` to rate limit everything after it.\
 Call it with no arguments to use a default reasonable value for clickable actions or whatever.

 function defaultdict(constructor, args)\
    assert(args==nil)\
    return setmetatable(args or {}, {\
        __index = function(tab, key)\
            local d = constructor(key)\
            tab[key] = d\
            return d\
        end,\
        __mode = mode\
    })\
 end\

        return memo(function(arg)\
            return nextmemo[funci(function(arg) return func(arg) end, weak)\
        end, weak)\

 The returned memo should be "called" by indexing it:\
 a = memo(function(x,y) return x*y end)\
 print(a[2][3]) --prints 6\
 If the function returns nil, nothing will be stored, and the second return value will be returned by the indexing.

*file: [lua/swamp/webmaterials/cl_webmaterials.lua (hidden)](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/webmaterials/cl_webmaterials.lua)*

### function RenderTarget(args)
Like CreateRenderTargetEx, but the args are a table with good defaults, you don't need a name, and if the ITexture gets garbage collected it can reuse the rendertarget for another call (since you can't delete RTs)
\
*file: [lua/swamp/webmaterials/cl_webmaterials.lua (hidden)](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/webmaterials/cl_webmaterials.lua)*
